# Introduction to scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python

[Link to slides](https://thomasjpfan.github.io/ml-workshop-intro/)

## About the workshop

Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that is used by many data science practitioners. Machine learning is a valuable tool used across many domains such as medicine, physics, and finance. We will start this training by learning about scikit-learnâ€™s API for supervised machine learning. scikit-learn's API mainly consists of three methods: fit, to build models, predict, to make predictions from models, and transform, to change the representation of the input data. This simple and consistent interface helps to abstract away the algorithm, thus allowing us to focus on our particular problems. Next, we will learn about preprocessing numerical data and its importance for certain machine learning models. Finally, we will learn how to combine these preprocessing techniques with a machine learning model by using a Pipeline.
